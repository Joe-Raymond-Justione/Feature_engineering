_Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract and create new features from raw data that can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models. This crucial step in the data preprocessing pipeline involves transforming and refining data to highlight the patterns and structures that machine learning algorithms can learn from more effectively._
